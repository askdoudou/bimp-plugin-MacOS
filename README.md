# BIMP for GIMP 2.10.22 / MacOS

## Prerequisites

Please note: this is a modified version from the original project (alessandrofrancesconi/gimp-plugin-bimp). With this, you can install the plugin with any further fixes nor errors.

Fromt the original source, You may encounter installation Error. Especially if you haven't had any previous plugins installation. The Error will tell you that the folder "plug-ins" dose not exist. Therefore, I made the change to avoid this error and make installation more quicker.


## How to install

Select "install" script file, and with a double click launch it. Or go ahead and open your terminal and "sh" the file's path.

Type ENTER to exit the script. After that, BIMP is installed in the proper GIMP 2.10.22 plug-ins folder.

For the first time, You may encounter a Warning message when opening GIMP ("BIMP cannot be opened..."). This is due to security settings of your Mac. Where Apple couldn't verifiy the plugin.
In this case, click "Cancel" and close GIMP. 
Then open System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> General tab.
Click "Allow Anyway" to unlock the BIMP executable.
Open GIMP again, this time the Warning message lets you click the "Open" button and continue the installation process.
That's it, you will do this only once. After that the plugin will be running smoothly.

Thank you.
